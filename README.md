# Hate Speech Detection in Roman Urdu Tweets
Hate Speech is a specfic type of a controversial content that is widely thought of as a crime and it needs to be identified and blocked. However due to large sum of twitter data it is very difficult to perform the hate speech detection manually. To address this issue many researchers and AI practitioner have conducted different studies and implemented algorithms to detect the abusive and offensive content in the tweets and flag them as inappropriate but these studies are carried out mostly on english language. There is a huge gap in research for implementing Machine learning algorithms on Roman Urdu/Hindi dataset to detect inappropriate tweets from the twitter data.<br />
In this project i have tried to implement different techniques of machine learning and deep learning to develope an algorithm which can help in classification of abusive content in roman urdu/hindi twitter data.<br />
Please feel free to use the code.<br />
Special Thanks for the dataset Link is given below <br />

## Project Brief
Social media is now very much incorporated in the modern life style. Most of the users try to use these platforms to express their feeling and thoughts to the world positively but there are huge number of complaints and cases where people try to use abusive/offensive language on the social media, which results in bullying of the social media users.<br />
In this project i have used the dataset from [https://github.com/haroonshakeel/roman_urdu_hate_speech], and by using diffrerent tools and techniques of natural language processing implemented an algorithm which helps in classifying the Normal/Neutral tweets from the Abusive and Hate speech tweets.

## Files Description
You will find three files in the project.<br />
Cleaned_data.csv: if you want to use already preprocessed file then you can consume this file and can implement your finding and techniques on it to develope the algorithms.<br />
Roman_Urdu_Hate_Speech_Dataset.csv: This file only contains the tweets and their respective labels.<br />
Roman_Urdu_Hate_Speech.ipynb: This is the notebook file which is built using google colab.
